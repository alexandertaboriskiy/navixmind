# navixmind
NavixMind is a local-first AI agent for Android (evt. iOS) that runs a ReAct reasoning loop powered by the Claude API. It can execute Python code in a sandboxed environment, process video/audio with FFmpeg, perform OCR via ML Kit, fetch and parse web pages, read/create PDFs, and integrate with Calendar/Gmail, all from a mobile chat interface.
